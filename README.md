# sudoku-solver
I have always been fascinated with Sudoku puzzles. I came across a problem on LeetCode when I was still very early in my coding journey, and it asked me to create code that could solve a sudoku.
At the time, I had no idea how to even approach it, but I thought about the problem every once in a while.

I am now at a point where I am able to solve sudoku puzzles with my java code, and that is here in my project. I am hoping to add functionality with a sudoku api in the near future.
That would allow me to automatically populate an unsolved sudoku puzzle, and truly test it against a wide variety of puzzles.

Definitely still a work in progress optimizing and making the code a bit cleaner, but it is a project that I am proud of so far!
